[Khaled:] DJ Khaled!
[T-Pain:] Hey! Yeah
[Khaled:] We the best!

[T-Pain:]
All I do is win, win, win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win, win, win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make them stay there

(Yeah, listen... Luda)

[Ludacris:]
Ludacris going in on the verse
'Cause I never been defeated and I won't stop now
Keep your hands up get 'em in the sky
For the homies didn't make it and my folks locked down
I never went nowhere
But they saying Luda's back
Blame it on that conjure
The hood call it Luda'gnac
And I'm on this foolish track so I spit my foolish flow
My hands go up and down like strippers booties go
My verses still be serving, tight like a million virgins
Last time on a Khaled remix now I'm on the original version
Can't never count me out
Y'all better count me in
Got 20 bank accounts, accountants count me in
Make millions every year, the South's champion
'Cause all I do, all I, all I, all I, all I do is

[T-Pain:]
All I do is win, win, win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win, win, win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make them stay there

(Win, win, who? Boss... Boss)

[Rick Ross:]
Swerving in my lo-lo
Head on the swivel
You know serving me's a no no
Clean as a whistle as I pull out in my Rolls Royce
Yellow bone passenger they see it, they say oh boy!
Tell Khaled back it up, my niggas call me loco
Down for armed trafficking, don't make me pull that fo-fo
Ask you what you laughing at (what?)
Represent that mud life
Dirty money bitch you better get your mud right
We come together holding hands and holla thug life
We're all strapped in all black
It's like thug life
(all we do is win)
You riding to what?
'Cause we riding tonight
Now she's riding with me 'cause you wasn't riding her right
Ross

[T-Pain:]
All I do is win, win, win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win, win, win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make them stay there

[Snoop Dogg:]
Heat in the kitchen, pot on the stove
Water getting boiled, dope being sold
Snoopy in the hoopty, system overload
I've been running this rap game since I was 20 years old
I hung with the worst of them
Bust 'til I burst 'em up
Floss 'em up, toss 'em up, hardaway, cross 'em up
Pardon me I'm bossing up
Pressure up, bless you bruh
Don't mess with us
We like the U in the 80s
Back to back set a trap
Hit the lick, hit it back
Hit the trick, jump the track
Bitch I want my money back
Time and time again while I'm sipping on this gin
Al Davis said it best, just win baby win

[T-Pain:]
All I do is win, win, win no matter what
Got money on my mind I can never get enough
And every time I step up in the building
Everybody hands go up
And they stay there
And they say yeah
And they stay there
Up down, up down, up down
'Cause all I do is win, win, win
And if you goin' in put your hands in the air
Make them stay there
