Feedback

Based on your Sprint 2 presentation, we have the following feedback for your team: 
* The page for playing songs looks really good, I would maybe consider labeling the show lyrics button with words so a first time user is aware of it. 
You still have a fair bit of work for the last sprint but the core functionality of the app looks good. 

Additionally, we have the following feedback for all the class. You may find that some of this doesn't apply to your team, but please consider it as you plan for your final presentation. 
*  If you did not deploy in Sprint 2, you should prioritize deployment as soon as possible. 
*  You should ensure that your site is robust.  During the final presentation, your site should be as robust as possible. You should prioritize robustness over adding new features at this point.
*  We will be doing code review on your project during the final presentation.  You should ensure you are correctly validating any inputs in for your site.
