Project Specification Feedback
==================

Commit graded: 

### The product backlog (10/10)
I believe you guys do not plan on using any music API's, in the project description is says 
you are maybe using AudD or Spotify. IF you are using such API's you should make sure you are comfortable with them for Sprint 1 
### Data models (9/10)
The relationship between song and user should be a ForeignKey  

### Wireframes or mock-ups (10/10)

### Additional Information
One more piece of feedback would be possible could shoot for achieving some more features, perhaps a liking and disliking 
of songs creating an overall top chart or something like that, 
maybe some way of syncing lyrics with songs or adding video to songs if you get the chance would be cool as well
